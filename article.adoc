== Apache CXF JAX-RS Performance

We've investigated https://github.com/savoirtech/apache-cxf-soap-performance[Apache CXF Soap Performance] in our testing lab, now its time to focus on JAX-RS. We'll be using the same systems, so we'll get to see the through put difference between these approaches.

== The Setup

For our lab test we'll be using the following hardware:

* Dell PowerEdge R250 (Client Host)
** Intel Xeon E-2378 (8c, 16t)
** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
** 1 Gigabit Ethernet
** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* Raptor Blackbird (Server Host)
** IBM POWER9 v2 SMT4 Sforza (8c, 32 t)
** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
** 1 Gigabit Ethernet
** CentOS Stream 9

The machines are co-located on the same switch, reducing the number of packet hops.

== The Performance Harness

As of CXF 4.1 the binary distribution will contain a set of performance scripts in the samples folder. Options to test JAX-WS and JAX-RS are present.

At its core, the performance harness is a client-server request/response automation. On startup the script initializes and warms up the JVM for executing mass calls.

=== How it works

The client host runs a number of threads, each running a CXF client which calls the server host. For JAX-RS testing, we have a choice of calling using a verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The client side harness will run N threads for M times for the specified duration.

Once the time duration has been met, it will cease the executing clients, and tabulate the total calls.
